# Markdown Test

This is a LinkedinLearning course that I took, [Google Apps Script for JavaScript Developers](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/google-apps-script-for-javascript-developers/welcome?u=2150234).

In this course, I learned how to do the following:
1. Leveraged various Google APIs (DocumentApp, DriveApp).
2. Dynamically Create, Read, Update and Delete information (CRUD).
3. Iterating through project using Rapid Application Development (RAD) approach.
4. Separating code into bitesized chunks.
